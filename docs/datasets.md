# Datasets used in this project

This project uses six public medical imaging datasets. Raw images are **not**
distributed with the repository; users must obtain them from the original
sources under their respective licences. The local paths below are expressed
using the `DATA_ROOT` environment variable.

---

## Derm7pt

- **Path:** `${DATA_ROOT}/derm7pt`
- **Content on this machine:** 2013 images, 6 metadata files (see
  `data/governance/dataset_checksums.json`).
- **Notes:** Dermoscopic skin-lesion dataset with rich clinical metadata.
  Used here primarily for melanoma vs non-melanoma classification and
  interpretability experiments.

---

## ISIC 2018

- **Path:** `${DATA_ROOT}/isic_2018`
- **Content:** 10,015 images, 5 metadata files.
- **Notes:** ISIC 2018 challenge data. We use the classification task subset
  for dermoscopic lesion classification and XAI analysis.

---

## ISIC 2019

- **Path:** `${DATA_ROOT}/isic_2019`
- **Content:** 25,331 training images, 4 metadata files.
- **Notes:** Multi-class skin-lesion classification dataset. Used for
  evaluating scalability of the tri-objective models to more classes.

---

## ISIC 2020

- **Path:** `${DATA_ROOT}/isic_2020`
- **Content:** 33,126 images, 8 metadata files.
- **Notes:** SIIM-ISIC 2020 melanoma detection data. Used both for baseline
  CNN/ViT benchmarks and robustness/explainability studies.

---

## NIH ChestX-ray14

- **Path:** `${DATA_ROOT}/nih_cxr`
- **Content:** 26,684 DICOM images, 17 metadata files (labels and supporting
  CSVs).
- **Notes:** Frontal chest X-ray dataset with multiple thoracic disease labels.
  In this project we may use either the full dataset or a controlled subset,
  as detailed later in the methods chapter.

---

## PadChest (sample subset)

- **Path:** `${DATA_ROOT}/padchest`
- **Content:** 48 chest X-ray images, 3 metadata files.
- **Notes:** This directory currently contains a **small PadChest sample**
  used for pipeline development and quick prototyping. If larger-scale
  PadChest experiments are performed later, the corresponding path and file
  counts will be updated in `data/governance/dataset_checksums.json`.

## Integrity manifest

A machine-readable overview of all datasets (paths, file counts, manifest
hashes) is stored in:

- `data/governance/dataset_checksums.json`

This file is generated by:

```bash
python scripts/data/verify_datasets.py
